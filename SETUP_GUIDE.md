# Knowledge System Setup Guide

**Version:** 0.2.0  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for customizing your knowledge system templates

---

## Quick Start

After running `npx aiknowsys init`, you'll have three template files:
- `CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md` - Architecture and patterns (needs customization)
- `AGENTS.md` - AI workflow (mostly ready to use)
- `CODEBASE_CHANGELOG.md` - Session history (will grow over time)

**Two approaches to fill templates:**

1. **AI-Assisted** (Recommended): Use the AI prompt displayed after init
2. **Manual**: Follow the customization steps below

---

## Understanding Placeholders

All templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for values you need to fill in.

### Common Placeholders

| Placeholder | Example Value | Where Used |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | my-awesome-app | All templates |
| `{{DATE}}` | January 25, 2026 | All templates |
| `{{LANGUAGE}}` | TypeScript, Python | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{FRAMEWORK}}` | Next.js 14, Django 5 | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{VERSION}}` | Node 20.11.0, Python 3.12 | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` | Jest, pytest | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{BUILD_TOOL}}` | Vite, webpack | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{*_CMD}}` | npm test, pytest | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{*_DESCRIPTION}}` | Your explanation | ESSENTIALS |
| `{{*_EXAMPLE}}` | Real code snippets | ESSENTIALS |

### Placeholder Categories

- **`{{*_CMD}}`** - Actual commands to run (e.g., `{{TEST_CMD}}` → `npm test`)
- **`{{*_DESCRIPTION}}`** - Your explanations (e.g., `{{PATTERN_DESC}}` → "We use Repository pattern...")
- **`{{*_EXAMPLE}}`** - Real code examples (e.g., `{{CODE_EXAMPLE}}` → actual code from your project)
- **`{{*_STANDARD}}`** - Your conventions (e.g., `{{NAMING_STANDARD}}` → "camelCase for variables")

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES FOR CUSTOMIZATION

### ✅ DO:

1. **Replace placeholders with REAL values**
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD:  {{TEST_CMD}} → "Run your tests"
   ✅ GOOD: {{TEST_CMD}} → npm test
   ```

2. **Use actual code from YOUR project**
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD:  Generic example that could apply to any project
   ✅ GOOD: Actual function from src/utils/validator.ts with line numbers
   ```

3. **Keep section headings EXACTLY as written**
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD:  "Testing Patterns" → "Testing Guidelines"
   ✅ GOOD: "Testing Patterns" stays "Testing Patterns"
   ```

4. **Make content specific to YOUR codebase**
   ```markdown
   ❌ BAD:  "Follow best practices for error handling"
   ✅ GOOD: "All API routes use try/catch → handleApiError(err, res)"
   ```

5. **Remove sections that don't apply**
   - If you don't have a database, remove Database section
   - If no deployment pipeline, remove Deployment section
   - Don't leave placeholder-filled sections

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Change section headings** - AI agents rely on exact headings
2. **Replace placeholders with other placeholders** - Use real values
3. **Add generic content** - Everything should be project-specific
4. **Skip sections** - Fill them completely or remove them

---

## Template Customization Steps

### CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md

**Step 1: Technology Snapshot**
```markdown
Before:
| Runtime | {{LANGUAGE}} {{VERSION}} |

After:
| Runtime | Node.js 20.11.0 |
```

**Step 2: Validation Matrix** (Most Important!)
```markdown
Before:
| {{FILE_TYPE}} | {{VALIDATION_CMD}} | {{WHEN}} |

After:
| Any file | npm test | ✅ Before commit |
| TypeScript | npm run type-check | ✅ Before commit |
| Backend | npm run test:api | ✅ Before deploy |
```

**Step 3: Project Structure**
- Replace with YOUR actual directory structure
- Include key files and their purpose
- Use `tree` command or manually document

**Step 4: Core Patterns**
- Document YOUR actual coding patterns
- Include real code examples with file paths
- Show how you structure components/modules

**Step 5: Critical Invariants**
- Rules that MUST NEVER be violated
- Example: "All database queries must use parameterized queries"
- Example: "Never commit .env files"

**Step 6: Common Gotchas**
- Things that trip up developers
- Example: "PostgreSQL returns UTC timestamps, convert to local"
- Project-specific quirks and workarounds

**Step 7: Testing Patterns**
- How you organize tests
- Naming conventions
- What gets tested (unit/integration/e2e)

**Step 8: Architecture Decisions**
- Why you chose certain technologies
- Trade-offs you made
- When to use pattern A vs pattern B

**Step 9: Change Management**
- How you handle breaking changes
- If using OpenSpec: mention it here
- PR review process

**Step 10: Development Workflow**
- Local development setup
- How to run the project
- Build and deployment process

---

### AGENTS.md

**Step 1: Review Validation Matrix**

The validation matrix in AGENTS.md should reference the one in CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md. No duplication needed - agents read ESSENTIALS for the actual commands.

**Step 2: Remove Template Sections** (if present)

If you initialized from template, remove these sections:
- ✅ Pre-Commit Validation Checklist (with `{{VALIDATION_CMD_1}}` placeholders)
- 🔍 Troubleshooting Validation Failures (with `{{SINGLE_TEST_CMD}}` placeholders)
- 📝 Customization Instructions section

These are setup instructions, not runtime agent guidance. Once you've customized ESSENTIALS.md with real commands, AGENTS.md doesn't need placeholder-filled checklists.

**Step 3: Add Custom Skills to Trigger Words Table** (optional)

If you created custom skills in `.github/skills/`, add them to the skill mapping table.

**Replace `{{SKILL_MAPPING}}` with:**

```markdown
| Trigger Words | Skill to Read | Why |
|---------------|---------------|-----|
| "add command", "new feature", "implement" | `feature-implementation` | Proper command structure |
| "refactor", "clean up", "simplify" | `code-refactoring` | Test-driven refactoring |
| "update deps", "upgrade packages" | `dependency-updates` | Safe upgrade procedures |
| "update docs", "changelog" | `documentation-management` | AI-optimized docs |
| "create skill", "new skill" | `skill-creator` | Proper skill format |
| "write tests", "TDD", "test first" | `tdd-workflow` | Test-driven development |
| "test fail", "validation error", "build broken" | `validation-troubleshooting` | Debug validation failures |
```

Add your custom skills:
```markdown
| "deploy", "release" | `deployment-workflow` | Release procedure |
| "cache", "redis" | `redis-patterns` | Caching best practices |
```

**Step 4: Verify Best Practices Section**

Ensure the "General Best Practices" section matches your project culture:
```markdown
1. **Read first, code second** - Always check CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md
2. **Update proactively** - Don't wait for user to ask
3. **Be concise** - Keep summaries short
```

**What to keep:**
- ✅ Session Start Protocol (critical workflow)
- ✅ Quick Reference Checklist
- ✅ 6-step workflow
- ✅ TDD Self-Audit
- ✅ Continuous Learning protocol
- ✅ Skills Workflow section

**What to remove:**
- ❌ Any `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax
- ❌ "Customization Instructions" section
- ❌ Pre-commit checklist with placeholders
- ❌ Troubleshooting section with placeholders

---

### CODEBASE_CHANGELOG.md

**No immediate customization needed!**

- This file grows organically as you work
- Add a new session entry after each coding session
- See template for entry format

---

## Template Size: Minimal vs Full

### Minimal Template (10 sections)
**Best for:**
- Learning projects
- Prototypes
- Simple CLI tools
- Solo developer projects
- Internal scripts

**Sections removed:**
- Security Considerations
- Performance Guidelines
- Accessibility Standards

**When to upgrade to full:**
- Project goes to production
- Handling sensitive data
- Performance becomes critical
- Building user-facing UI

### Full Template (13+ sections)
**Best for:**
- Production applications
- Team projects
- Web applications
- APIs handling user data
- Performance-critical systems

**Additional sections:**
- Security (auth, data protection, vulnerabilities)
- Performance (optimization, caching, monitoring)
- Accessibility (WCAG, screen readers, keyboard nav)

---

## Working with AI Assistants

### AI-Assisted Setup (Recommended)

After running `npx aiknowsys init`, you'll see a prompt like:

```
🤖 AI Assistant Prompt:
   Copy this prompt to your AI assistant to complete setup:
   
   "I just initialized aiknowsys for my project...
   [detailed instructions]"
```

**Copy and paste this entire prompt to:**
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Claude Desktop
- ChatGPT
- Cursor
- Any AI coding assistant

The AI will:
1. Read your files
2. Scan your codebase
3. Fill in all placeholders with real values
4. Add project-specific examples

### Manual AI Assistance

If you prefer more control:

```
"I have a CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md template. Please:
1. Read the file
2. For the Technology Snapshot section, scan my package.json and fill in:
   - Runtime version
   - Framework and version
   - Build tool
   - Test framework
3. Keep all section headings unchanged
4. Replace {{PLACEHOLDERS}} with actual values from my code"
```

---

## Validation

After customizing, verify:

1. **No placeholders remain** (search for `{{`)
   ```bash
   grep -n "{{" CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md
   # Should return nothing or only intentional examples
   ```

2. **Validation Matrix commands work**
   ```bash
   # Test each command from your matrix
   npm test
   npm run lint
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Section headings are unchanged**
   - AI agents rely on exact section names
   - "Testing Patterns" not "Testing Guidelines"

4. **All content is project-specific**
   - No generic advice like "follow best practices"
   - Every example references YOUR code

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Leaving Generic Placeholders
```markdown
BAD:  {{TEST_ORGANIZATION}} → "Tests should be organized properly"
GOOD: {{TEST_ORGANIZATION}} → "Tests mirror src/ structure: src/auth/login.ts → tests/auth/login.test.ts"
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Changing Section Headings
```markdown
BAD:  ## Testing Patterns → ## Testing Guidelines
GOOD: ## Testing Patterns (keep exact heading)
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Generic Content
```markdown
BAD:  "Use proper error handling"
GOOD: "All async functions use try/catch → handleError(err, { context: 'functionName' })"
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Incomplete Examples
```markdown
BAD:  "See utils folder"
GOOD: "See [src/utils/validator.ts](src/utils/validator.ts#L45-L67) for Joi schema pattern"
```

## 🚀 First Implementation: What to Build Next

**You've finished setup! Now what?**

Here's the recommended order for your first implementation session:

### 1️⃣ Test Your Validation Matrix (5 minutes)

Before building anything, verify your validation commands work:

```bash
# Run each command from your Validation Matrix
npm test               # Should pass (even if no tests yet)
npm run lint          # Should pass
npm run type-check    # Should pass
npm run build         # Should succeed
```

**Why this matters:** Ensures you can validate your work before you start coding.

### 2️⃣ Set Up Your First Feature Branch (2 minutes)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/hello-world
```

**Why this matters:** Practice the workflow you'll use for all features.

### 3️⃣ Write Your First Test (10 minutes)

Pick the simplest possible feature (e.g., a "hello world" endpoint or utility function):

```bash
# Example for Node.js API
# test/api/health.test.js
test('GET /health returns 200', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/health');
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.body).toEqual({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

**Run it:** `npm test` → Should fail (RED phase) ✅

**Why this matters:** Validates your test setup works and practices TDD.

### 4️⃣ Implement the Feature (10 minutes)

Now write the minimal code to make the test pass:

```javascript
// src/routes/health.js
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok' });
});
```

**Run it:** `npm test` → Should pass (GREEN phase) ✅

**Why this matters:** Completes the RED-GREEN cycle and proves the workflow works.

### 5️⃣ Run Full Validation (2 minutes)

```bash
npm test              # Tests pass
npm run lint         # Code style OK
npm run type-check   # Types OK (if applicable)
npm run build        # Build succeeds
```

**Why this matters:** Practice the validation ritual you'll use for every change.

### 6️⃣ Update Changelog (5 minutes)

Add your first session entry to CODEBASE_CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
## Session: First Implementation (Jan 25, 2026)

**Goal**: Validate knowledge system workflow with simple feature

**Changes**:
- [test/api/health.test.js](test/api/health.test.js): Added health check test
- [src/routes/health.js](src/routes/health.js): Implemented /health endpoint

**Validation**:
- ✅ Tests: 1/1 passing
- ✅ Lint: No errors
- ✅ Build: Success

**Key Learning**: TDD workflow works! Writing test first revealed that Express wasn't configured yet.
```

**Why this matters:** Creates your first historical record and practices documentation.

### 7️⃣ Commit and Push (2 minutes)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add health check endpoint

- Add GET /health endpoint returning {status: 'ok'}
- Add test for health endpoint
- Validates knowledge system workflow

Tests: 1/1 passing
Validation: All checks pass"

git push origin feature/hello-world
```

**Why this matters:** Establishes good commit message habits from day one.

## 🎯 What You've Accomplished

After completing these steps, you've:

✅ Validated your entire toolchain works  
✅ Practiced TDD (RED → GREEN workflow)  
✅ Ran the full validation matrix  
✅ Updated the changelog  
✅ Made your first proper commit  

**Most importantly:** You've proven the knowledge system workflow works end-to-end!

---

## 📚 Next Steps

Now you're ready to build real features:

1. **Check AGENTS.md** - Review the workflow for each session
2. **Read relevant skills** - Before implementing features, check `.github/skills/`
3. **Follow the process** - Read ESSENTIALS → Plan → Code → Test → Validate → Document
4. **Keep iterating** - Each session makes the knowledge system more valuable

### Keeping ESSENTIALS Lean

**⚠️ Important:** CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md should stay focused (600-800 lines recommended).

**After customization:**
```bash
# Check if ESSENTIALS is bloated
npx aiknowsys check

# If >800 lines, analyze what can be extracted
npx aiknowsys compress-essentials --analyze

# Extract verbose sections to docs/patterns/
npx aiknowsys compress-essentials --auto
```

**Prevention tips:**
- Keep code examples under 15 lines
- Extract detailed guides to `docs/patterns/*.md`
- Link from ESSENTIALS instead of embedding
- Run `npx aiknowsys check` monthly to catch bloat early

**Why this matters:**
- Faster AI context loading
- Easier to navigate and maintain
- Better focus on core patterns vs implementation details

See [learned skill](.aiknowsys/learned/essentials-compression.md) for complete compression workflow.
