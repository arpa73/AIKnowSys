### Notes for Next Session

**Potential v0.5.0 Work:**
- Update skill-creator to support .aiknowsys/learned/ output (optional)
- Enhanced pattern library in all stack templates
  - Add "Common Patterns" section
  - python-django: CBVs, serializers, signals
  - typescript-nextjs: Server components, app router
  - Each pattern with code examples

**Success Metrics to Track:**
- Do agents check session files on start?
- Are session notes created after complex work?
- Are learned patterns saved and reused?
- Context continuity validated?

**Key Insight:**
Platform-agnostic implementation matched feature-richness of platform-specific tools. Documentation-driven protocols work across ANY AI assistant (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor).
