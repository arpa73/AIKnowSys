# Plans Directory

**Purpose:** Track what each developer is currently working on.

**How It Works:**
- Each developer has `active-<username>.md` (committed, visible to team)
- Shows current plan, status, progress
- No merge conflicts (separate files per developer)

**Workflow:**
1. Planner creates plan in `PLAN_*.md`
2. Developer updates `plans/active-<username>.md` to point to it
3. Teammates see who's working on what (avoid duplication)
4. On completion, developer marks plan complete

**Team Index:**
See `CURRENT_PLAN.md` for aggregated view of all active plans.
