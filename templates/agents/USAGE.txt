# Custom Agents - Developer & Architect Workflow

**Purpose:** Automated quality gate that enforces CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md patterns during development.

---

## How It Works

### The Agent Pair

1. **Developer Agent** (`developer.agent.md`)
   - Primary implementer of features
   - Writes code following documented patterns
   - Automatically hands off to Architect for review
   - Refactors based on feedback

2. **Architect Agent** (`architect.agent.md`)
   - Reviews code against CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md
   - Enforces KISS, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI principles
   - Approves or requests changes
   - Provides specific, actionable feedback

## Usage

### In VS Code with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

**Start with Developer:**
```
@Developer add a new feature to calculate user retention rate
```

**Developer will:**
1. Implement the code
2. Write tests
3. Automatically call: `@SeniorArchitect please review changes in [file] against CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md`

**You don't need to manually call Architect** - the handoff is automatic!

### Direct Review Request

If you've made changes manually and want a review:
```
@SeniorArchitect review the changes I made to src/utils/metrics.ts
```

---

## What Architect Checks

### ✅ KISS (Keep It Simple)
- No overly complex nested logic
- Readable function/variable names
- Clear control flow

### ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- No duplicated logic
- Proper abstraction into functions/classes
- Reuse existing utilities

### ✅ SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility (functions do one thing)
- Dependency Inversion (inject dependencies)
- Interface segregation

### ✅ YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- No speculative "future-proofing"
- Features are actually needed now
- No premature optimization

### ✅ CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md Compliance
- Follows documented patterns
- Uses approved libraries/tools
- Respects project constraints

---

## Configuration

### Customizing `model` and `tools` (Advanced)

The YAML frontmatter at the top of each agent file controls which AI model and capabilities the agent has access to.

**`model`** - Which AI model the agent uses:
```yaml
model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
```
- **What it does:** Selects the AI model for that specific agent
- **Recommendation:** Keep consistent across Developer/Architect unless you have a specific reason
- **Note:** Your host environment (VS Code, IDE) may override or ignore this setting

**`tools`** - Which capabilities the agent can use:
```yaml
tools: ['search', 'edit/editFiles', 'edit/createFile']
```
- **What it does:** Defines the agent's permission boundary (what actions it can perform)
- **Recommendation:** Least privilege principle - only grant necessary tools
- **Current defaults:**
  - **Developer:** `['search', 'edit/editFiles', 'edit/createFile']`
    - Needs edit tools to implement features and write code
    - Needs search to read ESSENTIALS and existing code
  - **SeniorArchitect:** `['search', 'edit/editFiles', 'edit/createFile']`
    - Needs edit tools to write `.aiknowsys/PENDING_REVIEW.md` and update session files
    - Needs search to read ESSENTIALS and review code changes
  - **Planner:** `['search', 'edit/editFiles', 'edit/createFile', 'todo', 'agent', 'web']`
    - Broader set for planning automation, research, and session management

**Tradeoffs:**
- If you remove `edit` tools from Architect, it can't write the review artifact or update sessions
- If you remove `search`, agents can't read ESSENTIALS or scan existing code
- More tools = more capability, but also more potential for unexpected actions

**Where to edit:**
- **In your installed project:** Edit `.github/agents/developer.agent.md`, `architect.agent.md`, or `planner.agent.md`
- **In this template repo:** Edit `templates/agents/*.agent.template.md` to change what gets installed by default

### Customizing Review Criteria

Edit `.github/agents/architect.agent.md`:

```markdown
### Project-Specific Rules:
- All API calls must use the generated OpenAPI client
- Components must use TypeScript strict mode
- Error handling must use try/catch with logger
- Database queries must use Django ORM (no raw SQL)
```

### Customizing Developer Behavior

Edit `.github/agents/developer.agent.md`:

```markdown
### Your Coding Standards:
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Use async/await (no .then() chains)
- Log errors with structured logging
- Document complex logic with comments
```

## Benefits

| Traditional Workflow | With Custom Agents |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Write code → Submit PR → Wait for human review → Fix issues → Resubmit | Write code → Instant automated review → Fix issues → Auto re-review |
| Inconsistent feedback across reviewers | Consistent enforcement of standards |
| Human reviewers check style + logic + architecture | Agents check style/patterns, humans focus on architecture |
| Feedback loop: hours to days | Feedback loop: seconds |
| Patterns drift over time | Patterns enforced on every change |

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Code Approval

**User:** `@Developer add a function to format currency`

**Developer implements:**
```typescript
export function formatCurrency(amount: number): string {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD'
  }).format(amount);
}
```

**Developer handoff:** `@SeniorArchitect please review formatCurrency in utils/format.ts`

**Architect response:** `LGTM - Architect Approved ✅`
- Uses standard library (Intl.NumberFormat)
- Single responsibility
- No duplication

### Example 2: Issues Found

**User:** `@Developer add validation for email addresses`

**Developer implements:**
```typescript
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  // Complex regex copied from Stack Overflow
  return /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$/.test(email);
}
```

**Architect response:**
```
❌ Review Failed - Issues Found:

1. **DRY Violation** in [src/utils/validation.ts](src/utils/validation.ts#L12)
   - Email validation already exists in src/composables/useAuth.ts
   - Refactor: Extract shared validation to src/utils/validators.ts
   - Rationale: Duplicate regex means inconsistent validation rules

2. **Documentation** in [src/utils/validation.ts](src/utils/validation.ts#L11)
   - Complex regex needs explanation
   - Add comment: What email formats are accepted/rejected
   - Rationale: Future maintainers need to understand edge cases

Please address these issues and resubmit.
```

**Developer refactors and re-submits → Architect approves ✅**

## Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't auto-handoff

**Check:** Is `send: true` in the handoff configuration?
```yaml
handoffs:
  - label: "Send to Architect"
    agent: SeniorArchitect
    prompt: "Please review..."
    send: true  # ← Must be true for auto-handoff
```

### Architect can't read CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md

**Check:** Does Architect have `search` tool enabled?
```yaml
tools: [search, search/changes]  # ← Required
```

### Review is too strict / too lenient

**Customize:** Edit architect.agent.md review checklist and criteria.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Let the workflow happen** - Don't interrupt the auto-handoff
2. **Read Architect feedback carefully** - It references specific sections of ESSENTIALS
3. **Update ESSENTIALS when patterns change** - Architect enforces what's documented
4. **Use Developer for implementation** - Use direct chat for questions/exploration
5. **Iterate with feedback** - Refactor and resubmit until approved

---

## Integration with Knowledge System

The agents are part of the broader knowledge system:

```
CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md  ←─┐
                          │
AGENTS.md (workflow)      │
                          │ Architect reads
Skills (how-to guides)    │ and enforces
                          │
Custom Agents  ───────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. Patterns documented in ESSENTIALS
2. Workflow enforced by AGENTS.md
3. Detailed steps in Skills
4. **Automated enforcement by Custom Agents**

---

*This creates a self-reinforcing system where good patterns are documented, taught, and automatically enforced.*
