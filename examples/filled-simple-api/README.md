# Filled Example: Simple Task API

> **What is this?** A completed example showing what your aiknowsys documentation should look like after setup.

---

## 📖 About This Example

This is a **realistic, filled example** of aiknowsys documentation for a simple Node.js + Express REST API project.

**Project Type:** Task Management API  
**Complexity:** Small (learning/prototype)  
**Tech Stack:** Node.js 20, Express 4, PostgreSQL, Jest  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Before filling templates, many developers ask:**
- "What does a completed template look like?"
- "How specific should I be?"
- "Should I keep all sections?"

**This example answers those questions.**

---

## 📁 What's Included

1. **CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md** - Fully filled, realistic content
   - Real validation commands (not placeholders)
   - Actual code examples from the project
   - Specific patterns and gotchas
   - 10 core sections (removed optional ones)

2. **AGENTS.md** - Customized workflow
   - Validation matrix filled in
   - Project-specific skill mapping
   - Actual test commands

3. **CODEBASE_CHANGELOG.md** - Sample session entries
   - Initial setup session
   - Feature implementation session
   - Shows format and detail level

---

## 🔍 How to Use This Example

### 1. **Read First, Then Fill Your Own**
```bash
# Look at this example
cat examples/filled-simple-api/CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md

# Then fill your own project
cd your-project
# Ask your AI assistant to onboard using:
# .github/onboarding-setup.md
```

### 2. **Compare Side-by-Side**
Open both files:
- `examples/filled-simple-api/CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md` (reference)
- `your-project/CODEBASE_ESSENTIALS.md` (yours to fill)

### 3. **Copy Patterns, Not Content**
✅ **DO:** Use similar structure and specificity  
❌ **DON'T:** Copy-paste generic content

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways from This Example

### ✅ Good Practices Shown

1. **Concrete Commands**
   ```markdown
   ❌ Bad:  "Run tests"
   ✅ Good: "npm test -- --coverage"
   ```

2. **Real Code Examples**
   ```markdown
   ❌ Bad:  "Use async/await for database calls"
   ✅ Good: Shows actual query function with error handling
   ```

3. **Specific Gotchas**
   ```markdown
   ❌ Bad:  "Be careful with dates"
   ✅ Good: "PostgreSQL stores timestamps in UTC but returns in server timezone"
   ```

4. **Removed Irrelevant Sections**
   - No "Accessibility Standards" (API project)
   - No "Performance Guidelines" (simple learning project)
   - Kept 10 core sections that matter

## 📊 Template Comparison

| Section | Template | This Example | Why Removed? |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Technology Stack | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Validation Matrix | ✅ | ✅ | **KILLER FEATURE** |
| Project Structure | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Core Patterns | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Critical Invariants | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Common Gotchas | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Testing Patterns | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Architecture Decisions | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Change Management | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Development Workflow | ✅ | ✅ | Core section |
| Security | ✅ | ❌ | Too advanced for learning project |
| Performance | ✅ | ❌ | Not optimized yet |
| Accessibility | ✅ | ❌ | API has no UI |

**Result:** 10 sections instead of 13 - cleaner, focused, still comprehensive

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

By reading this example, you'll understand:
- How specific to be (very!)
- What "real examples" means
- When to remove sections
- How to write useful gotchas
- What the validation matrix should contain
- How to document architecture decisions

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Read** this example thoroughly
2. **Initialize** your own project via `.github/onboarding-setup.md`
3. **Fill** your templates using this as reference
4. **Remove** sections that don't apply to your project
5. **Validate** your setup works (run the validation matrix!)

---

**Remember:** Your docs should be as specific as this example, but tailored to YOUR project. Don't copy generic content - write about YOUR code, YOUR patterns, YOUR gotchas.
